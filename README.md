## A test task for a job application in Data Science
The task:
Write a CLI application that
1. takes the path to an audio file as input
2. reads it into a numpy array
3. augments using the processor from step 1
4. saves the result to an audio file.

You cannot use code generated by any LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) in your answer to the task.
You can and are encouraged to use C/C++ Python extensions developed as part of this task.
You can and are encouraged to use external applications for working with audio via Linux pipes using the subprocess module.
The presence of unit tests is welcome, as well as the design of the application in a full-fledged Python package.
